# UCI Bank Marketing Analysis

## Context

As a part of the final project for the CareerFoundry Data Analysis Course, I was task to source my own data in order to conduct an Exploratory Visual Analysis using Python and to find connections between variables to see if they are worth exploring. Once I have developed an hypothesis, I would be doing various advanced analysis approaches to help test my hypothesis.

The results of the analysis will be presented in the format of a Tableau dashboard

## Project Data Requirements

As I sourced my own data, I still needed to make sure that my project adheres to certain criteria:

The data set(s) must:

● Be open-source.

● Come from an authentic/authoritative source.

● Include non-anonymized column names.

● Be recent (no more than 3 years old).

● Contain at least 5 continuous variables (for the main set).

● Contain at least 5 categorical variables (for the main set).

● Contain at least 5,000 rows (for the main set).

● Include a geographical object of some kind: for instance, relating to a country,
continent, or something similar. Data like this contains a column that marks where
the observation comes from. If the information from the data set refers to the U.S.,
for example, there should be a column containing the names/abbreviations of the
states. This is important for the geospatial analysis you’ll be conducting (see next
requirement).

● Be able to be paired with a shapefile (that corresponds to the geographic object in
the main data set). You’ll receive guidance on sourcing this data in the relevant
Exercise.

● Include a time series that refers to the same geographic object—or at least relate to
the domain of your data. This can be a data set separate from your main data set, so
long as it relates to your main data set. You’ll receive guidance on sourcing this data
in the relevant Exercise.

## Analysis Critera

I conducted the following analyses within my project:

● Exploratory analysis through visualizations (scatterplots, correlation heatmaps, pair
plots and categorical plots).

● Geospatial analysis using a shapefile.

● Regression analysis.

● Cluster analysis.
 
● Time-series analysis.

● Analysis narrative and final results (presented in a dashboard).

## Project Introduction

UCI are running a marketing campaign in order to try and get clients to subscribe to their term deposit product.
The provided dataset file containing 45211 records from 2018 - 2020.
They want to see if there are any valuable insights that can be used in order to improve their marketing campaign.
